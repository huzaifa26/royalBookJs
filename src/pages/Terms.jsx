The arbitrator’s award will be final and binding on all parties, except: (1) For judicial review expressly permitted by law; or (2) If the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party will have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that will not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law.
